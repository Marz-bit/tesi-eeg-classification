# tesi-eeg-classification
This codes were used in the development of a work of thesis based on building a decision-tree-like hierarchical ANN architecture for EEG signal classification. The file bci_train_test_suites.py is not complete and some other files which contained some used functions are not avialable due to their intended use in the upcoming edition of the Cybathlon competition, the files cannot be publicly shared at this time, as they have not yet been officially released by the PPKE research team.
